The following Haskell code attempts to implement a function that checks if a list is sorted, but contains a subtle bug related to pattern matching and laziness:

```haskell
isSorted :: Ord a => [a] -> Bool
isSorted [] = True
isSorted [x] = True
isSorted (x:y:xs) = x <= y && isSorted (y:xs)
```

The bug is that it does not correctly handle the case where the list has only one element. The pattern `(x:y:xs)` requires at least two elements, causing an error when the input list is a singleton.
